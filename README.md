Full-Stack Developer Assessment: Log Ingestion and
Querying System

Part I: The Project Brief - A Log Ingestion and Querying System
Section 1.1: Introduction and Core Objective
This document outlines the requirements for a full-stack take-home assignment
designed to assess proficiency in Node.js, React, and general software engineering
principles. The project is scoped to be complete within a single day (approximately 6-
8 hours of focused work) by a developer with around three years of full-stack
experience.
The core objective is to build a self-contained "Log Ingestion and Querying System."
This application will simulate a real-world developer tool used for monitoring and
debugging applications. Such tools are fundamental in modern software development
for providing visibility into system behavior, performance, and errors.1 This task
provides a practical context that is more indicative of real-world engineering
challenges than abstract exercises or overly simplified applications like to-do lists.3
The system will consist of two primary components:
1. A Log Ingestor: A backend service built with Node.js that exposes an API
endpoint to accept and store log data.
2. A Log Query Interface: A frontend application built with React that allows a user
to search, filter, and view the logs that have been ingested.
This assignment is designed to evaluate a candidate's ability to build a complete,
functional feature from front to back, touching upon API design, data handling, state
management, and user interface development. It provides an opportunity to
showcase knowledge of common building blocks in web applications, such as API
integration, data manipulation, and creating a responsive user experience.3

Section 1.2: Functional Requirements (User Stories)
The application's functionality should be guided by the following user stories. These
stories define the minimum viable product and represent the core features that must
be implemented for a successful submission.

Log Ingestion
● As a system, I can send a POST request containing a single log entry in a
predefined JSON format to a specific API endpoint, so that the log is durably
stored for later analysis.
Log Viewing and Filtering
● As a developer, I can view all ingested logs in a clean, reverse-chronological list
(most recent first) to get an immediate overview of recent activity.
● As a developer, I can perform a case-insensitive, full-text search across the
message field of all logs to quickly find entries containing specific keywords or
error messages.
● As a developer, I can filter the logs by their level (e.g., 'error', 'info', 'warning')
using a dropdown or multi-select component to isolate logs of a certain severity.
● As a developer, I can filter logs to show only those that fall within a specific
timestamp range by selecting a start and end date/time, enabling me to
investigate incidents that occurred during a specific period.
● As a developer, I can filter logs by their resourceId by typing into a text field,
allowing me to see all logs originating from a particular server, service, or
application instance.
● As a developer, I can combine multiple filters simultaneously (e.g., filtering for
'error' level logs containing the word "database" within the last 24 hours from
"server-1234") to perform highly specific and targeted searches.

Section 1.3: User Interface (UI) Guidance and Inspiration
While a pixel-perfect design is not required, the usability and clarity of the interface
are important. The goal is to create a functional and intuitive tool for a developer
audience. Instead of a rigid wireframe, this section provides guidance on the key
components and suggests sources of inspiration, allowing for a degree of creative
interpretation. This approach assesses the ability to translate functional requirements
into a practical UI, a common task for full-stack developers.6

Key UI Components
1. Filter Bar: A prominent and persistent section, likely at the top of the page,
should house all filtering controls. This area should be logically organized and
clearly labeled. It must contain:

○ A text input field for the full-text search on the message field.
○ A dropdown or multi-select component for the level filter.
○ A text input field for the resourceId filter.
○ Two date/time input fields to define the timestamp range (start and end).
○ A "Search" or "Apply Filters" button, or preferably, the log view should update
dynamically as filter values change.
2. Log Results View: The main area of the page should display the filtered log

entries. The presentation should be clean and easy to scan. A tabular or list-
based layout is recommended. Each log entry displayed should be clearly

distinguishable from the next.
3. Visual Cues for Log Levels: To enhance readability and quick diagnosis, log
entries should be visually distinct based on their level. For example, 'error' logs
could have a red left border or a light red background, 'warning' logs could use
yellow, and 'info' logs could use blue or grey. This demonstrates attention to user
experience details.6

UI/UX Inspiration and Best Practices
Candidates are encouraged to draw inspiration from established, professional-grade
logging and monitoring tools. The aim is to replicate their clarity and functionality, not
their entire feature set.
● Professional Tooling as a Benchmark: Interfaces from tools like Grafana Loki,
Datadog, or Splunk serve as excellent examples of effective log query UIs. Notice
how they handle high-density information, provide powerful filtering
mechanisms, and use color to convey meaning.7 Dribbble also hosts many
inspirational designs for log dashboards and developer tools that showcase clean
layouts and modern aesthetics.8 Designs such as "Prefect Logs," which clearly
delineates log levels, and "Infrastructure change logs," which presents a clean
dashboard, are particularly relevant.8
● Interactive Filtering: The filtering experience should be fluid. As a user modifies
a filter (e.g., types in the search box or selects a new level), the log results should
update dynamically without requiring a full page reload. This demonstrates a
solid understanding of React's state management and event handling
capabilities.9 A more experienced developer might consider performance
optimizations, such as debouncing the text input to prevent excessive API calls
while the user is typing.

● Clarity and Simplicity: The design should prioritize simplicity and avoid clutter.
A clean, minimalistic layout allows the log data itself to be the focus. The user
should be able to understand how to use the interface immediately without
instruction.6
The design of the UI is an opportunity to demonstrate a practical "product sense." A
candidate who not only implements the required functionality but also presents it in a
clean, logical, and user-friendly manner will be viewed more favorably. This simulates
a real-world scenario where developers must often build functional interfaces based
on specifications rather than pixel-perfect mockups.

Part II: Technical Specifications and Implementation Guidance
This section provides the technical constraints and specific implementation details
necessary to complete the project. Adherence to these specifications is a primary
evaluation criterion.

Section 2.1: Backend API Specification (Node.js & Express)
The backend server must be implemented using Node.js and the Express.js
framework.
Data Persistence Mandate
A critical requirement of this assignment is the method of data persistence. The
application must use a single JSON file as its database. The use of any external
database systems (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite) or cloud-based storage
services (e.g., Firebase, DynamoDB) is explicitly disallowed.
This constraint is intentional. It forces the implementation of all querying, filtering, and
sorting logic directly within the Node.js application layer. This provides a direct and
unambiguous signal of the candidate's proficiency with core JavaScript data
manipulation techniques (e.g., Array.prototype methods like filter, map, sort) and their
ability to handle data in memory. This approach simplifies the project's setup
dependencies, allowing the candidate to focus their limited time on the application
logic itself, which is the primary subject of evaluation.11
To facilitate this, candidates may use a library like node-json-db 14 for convenience in

reading from and writing to the JSON file, or they may implement their own file
system logic using Node's built-in
fs module.15 The choice of implementation should be documented in the
README.md file.
Table 1: Log Data Schema
All log entries, both in the request body for ingestion and in the response body for
queries, must adhere to the following JSON schema. This schema is based on
common structured logging practices, where logs are treated as data with consistent
key-value pairs rather than unstructured strings.1

Field Type Description Example Required
level String The severity
level of the log.
Must be one of:
error, warn, info,
debug.

"error" Yes

message String The primary log
message. This
field will be the

target of full-
text searches.

"Failed to
connect to
database."

Yes

resourceId String The identifier of
the resource
that generated
the log (e.g., a
server name,
container ID).

"server-1234" Yes

timestamp String The ISO 8601
formatted
timestamp
indicating when
the log event
occurred.

"2023-09-
15T08:00:00Z"
Yes

traceId String A unique "abc-xyz-123" Yes

identifier used
to correlate logs
from a single
request or
transaction
across multiple
services.
spanId String A unique
identifier for a
specific
operation or
"span" within a
trace.

"span-456" Yes

commit String The git commit
hash of the
code version
that generated
the log.

"5e5342f" Yes

metadata Object A nested JSON
object
containing
additional,
unstructured
context relevant
to the log entry.

{"parentResourc

eId": "server-
5678"}

Yes

Table 2: REST API Endpoint Specification
The backend server must implement the following RESTful API endpoints. The design
adheres to standard REST conventions, using HTTP methods to denote actions and
endpoint paths to represent resources.17 A well-defined API contract is fundamental
to successful full-stack development, and this table serves as that contract.

Method Path Description Query Parameters

returned.

Status: 500
Internal Server
Error for any

Section 2.2: Frontend Application Specification (React)
The frontend client application must be built using React. Bootstrapping the project
with a standard tool like create-react-app or Vite is recommended for a quick setup.9
Core Requirements
● Component Architecture: The application should be built using functional
components and leverage React Hooks (primarily useState and useEffect) for
state management and side effects.9

● State Management: There is no requirement to use a global state management
library such as Redux or MobX. Component-level state managed with useState or
state shared via the Context API is sufficient for the scope of this project.9
However, candidates are free to use a more advanced library if they believe it is
justified and should explain their reasoning in the
README.md.
● API Integration: All communication with the backend API should be handled
cleanly. The native fetch API or a library like axios are both acceptable choices.9
API call logic should be well-organized, likely within
useEffect hooks or custom hooks.
● Responsiveness: The UI should be designed for a standard desktop browser
view. While a fully mobile-responsive design is not required, the layout should not
break on typical desktop screen sizes.
The structure of the frontend application should reflect a clear separation of
concerns. For example, UI components, API service functions, and custom hooks
should be organized into logical directories. This demonstrates an understanding of
maintainable and scalable frontend architecture.

Part III: Evaluation Criteria and Submission Guidelines
This section details how the submission will be evaluated and provides instructions on
how to submit the completed project. Transparency in the evaluation process is key,
so these criteria should be reviewed carefully.

Section 3.1: Core Competencies Assessed
The assignment is designed to measure a range of competencies that are critical for
a successful full-stack developer:
● Backend Logic: The correctness and efficiency of the API implementation. This
includes proper request handling, robust data filtering that works with combined
criteria, and strict adherence to the specified data schema.
● Frontend Logic: The correct use of React principles, including component
composition, state management, and handling of side effects for API integration.
The implementation of all required UI functionality (filtering, searching, displaying

data) will be verified.
● Code Quality & Best Practices: The overall quality of the codebase. This is a
broad category that includes readability, consistency in style, logical project
structure (both frontend and backend), the appropriate use of comments, and
effective error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks, sending appropriate HTTP error
codes).
● Problem Solving: The candidate's approach to translating the project
requirements into a functional application. This is assessed by observing the
design choices made in the code.
● Documentation: The clarity, completeness, and professionalism of the
README.md file. Good documentation is a critical, and often overlooked,
engineering skill.

Section 3.2: Detailed Evaluation Rubric
To ensure a fair, consistent, and objective evaluation process, all submissions will be
assessed against the following rubric.

Section 3.3: Optional Bonus Challenges
For candidates who complete the core requirements with time to spare, the following
optional challenges provide an opportunity to showcase additional skills. These are
not required, and a submission will not be penalized for their absence.
1. Real-Time Log Ingestion: Implement WebSockets 3 on the server and client.
When a new log is ingested via the
POST /logs endpoint, the server should push the new log data to all connected
clients, causing the UI to update in real-time without requiring a refresh.
2. Basic Analytics View: Add a small dashboard component to the UI that displays
a simple chart (e.g., using a library like Chart.js or Recharts) showing the count of
logs by level over the currently filtered time range.
3. Containerization: Provide a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file that
allows the entire full-stack application (backend and frontend) to be built and run
with a single docker-compose up command.
4. Unit Testing: Add a few meaningful unit tests for a critical piece of the
application's logic. An excellent candidate for this would be the backend filtering
function, with tests covering various combinations of filters.
Section 3.4: Submission Instructions
Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure your submission can be reviewed
efficiently.
1. The entire project, including both the frontend and backend code, must be
contained within a single Git repository.
2. Submit a link to this repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab). Please ensure the
repository is public or that you have provided access to the evaluators.
3. The root of the repository must contain a README.md file.
4. The README.md file is a critical part of your submission and must include:
○ A brief overview of the project and your approach.
○ Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install all necessary dependencies

for both the frontend and backend applications.
○ Unambiguous instructions on how to run both the frontend and backend
servers.
○ A brief explanation of any significant design decisions, trade-offs, or
assumptions you made. For example, explain your choice of libraries or your
approach to the file-based persistence.
○ (If applicable) Instructions on how to run any tests or bonus features you
implemented.
